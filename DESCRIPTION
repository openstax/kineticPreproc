Description: This package reads in OpenStax Kinetic activity data from the Qualtrics API and preprocesses it to remove minor respondents, non-consenting respondents, identifying information, and test cases. 
    It extracts the Qualtrics survey questions and related metadata.
    It also creates summary statistics for researchers to guide their analytic scripts using simulated data on the Kinetic Secure Enclaves.
